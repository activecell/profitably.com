    <h1 class="heading">Dear faithful Profitably customers,</h1>

    <p>
      I am excited and proud to announce that the product we labored over for years 
      as "Profitably" is now "activecell." You can find us now at 
      <a href="www.activecell.com">www.activecell.com</a>. The change comes as our 
      company and product have both undergone massive  changes in order to bring you 
      the finest small business management platform in the marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team is now 23 strong and growing. Our product is a powerful platform rebuilt
      from scratch to meet the needs of small business owners and managers of all 
      stripes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I am pleased that we have a handful of <em>very</em> exciting 
      partnerships in the works that will bring a wealth of expertise to the table. That
      is because running a business is much more than the tools you use--it has everything 
      to do with the people you work with and how you are able to learn from their
      expertise.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>So what now?</strong></h2>

    <p>
      We hope you give activecell a try. If you use the code <strong>PROFITABLY.COM</strong> 
      when you register, we'll give you 10% off just because we like you. (grins.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Warm regards,<br />
      <strong>Adam Neary</strong><br />
      Founder &amp; CEO, Profitably, Inc.
    </p>
